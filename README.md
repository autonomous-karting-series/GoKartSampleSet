# GoKartSampleSet
This is to create a collection of go-kart photos that teams can use to train models for detecting go-karts.

# Instructions:
1. Take 100 photos of your team's go-kart.
2. Photos should be taken:
   - at different angles all around the go-kart
   - at ~1-3feet off of the ground (to simulate being viewed by another go-kart)
   - at different distances from the go-kart
3. Create a branch or fork the repository and add the images to the [images](/images) folder.
4. Create a PR from the branch or fork to get them added to the collection.
